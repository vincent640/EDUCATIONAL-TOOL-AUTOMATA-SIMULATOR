# EDUCATIONAL-TOOL-AUTOMATA-SIMULATOR
Making an educational tool for automata simulator(nfa &amp; dfa only)
similar to jflap with following requirements: 
1) click open software that will open a gui like jflap with a canvas where you can create nfa/dfa using buttons (drag/drop)  
2) can simulate input strings step by step using (next/forward) button that shows the current state by highlighting the state in the canvas- exactly like the first two demo videos you sent in GitHub  
3)  nfa to dfa conversion can be seen step by step by using next step button (like point 2) that outputs the equivalent dfa in the canvas  
4)  can save and load nfa/dfa
